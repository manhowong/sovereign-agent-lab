# ── Task B ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The scaffold ships with a working generate_event_flyer that has two paths:
#
#   - Live mode: if FLYER_IMAGE_MODEL is set in .env, the tool calls that
#     model and returns a real image URL.
#   - Placeholder mode: otherwise (the default) the tool returns a
#     deterministic placehold.co URL with mode="placeholder".
#
# Both paths return success=True. Both count as "implemented" for grading.
# This is not the original Task B — the original asked you to write a direct
# FLUX image call, but Nebius removed FLUX on 2026-04-13. See CHANGELOG.md
# §Changed for why we pivoted the task.

# Did your run of the flyer tool produce a success=True result?
# (This will be True for both live and placeholder mode — both are valid.)
TASK_B_IMPLEMENTED = True   # True or False

# Which path did your run take? "live" or "placeholder"
# Look for the "mode" field in the TOOL_RESULT output of Task B.
# If you didn't set FLYER_IMAGE_MODEL in .env, you will get "placeholder".
TASK_B_MODE = "placeholder"

# The image URL returned by the tool. Copy exactly from your terminal output.
# In placeholder mode this will be a placehold.co URL.
# In live mode it will be a provider CDN URL.

TASK_B_PROMPT_USED = "Professional event flyer for Edinburgh AI Meetup, tech professionals, modern venue at The Haymarket Vaults, Edinburgh. 160 guests tonight. Warm lighting, Scottish architecture background, clean modern typography."

The tool returned the result with a shape that still satisfies the tool
contract.

# ── Task C ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Scenario 1: first choice unavailable
# Quote the specific message where the agent changed course. Min 20 words.
SCENARIO_1_PIVOT_MOMENT = """
The first tool response showed that The Bow Bar's capacity is only 80, which is insufficient. So, the next logical step was to check another venue.

SCENARIO_1_FALLBACK_VENUE = "The Albanach"

# Scenario 2: impossible constraint (300 guests)
# Did the agent recommend a pub name not in the known venues list?

# Paste the final [AI] message.
SCENARIO_2_FINAL_ANSWER = """
None of the known Edinburgh venues can accommodate 300 guests with vegan options. The maximum capacity among the checked venues is 200 (The Guilford Arms, but no vegan options), and the largest vegan-capable venue (The Albanach) only holds 180 people. You may need to consider alternative venues outside this list or adjust your requirements.
"""

# Scenario 3: out of scope (train times)
# Did the agent try to call a tool?
SCENARIO_3_TRIED_A_TOOL = False   # True or False

SCENARIO_3_RESPONSE = "I don't have access to real-time train schedules or transportation data. For the most accurate information about the last train from Edinburgh Waverley to London, I recommend checking:\n1. The National Rail website (https://www.nationalrail.co.uk)\n2. Train service apps like Citymapper or Trainline\n3. The specific train operator's website (e.g., LNER)\n\nWould you like help with anything related to Edinburgh pubs, weather, or event planning instead?"

# Would this behaviour be acceptable in a real booking assistant? Min 30 words.
SCENARIO_3_ACCEPTABLE = """
Yes. The agent explained why the prompt was out of scope and why it could not 
answer the user's request. It suggested what the user can do without providing 
hallucinated responses. It also suggested what it can do in terms of booking 
venues (what it was designed for) based on the tools it has access to.

TASK_D_COMPARISON = """
LangGraph shows that the agent decides what tools to call and when to end the reasoning loop.
However, flow.yml shows a linear flow where the steps are pre-defined 
(e.g. collecting required data before executing the final action). In other words,
the agent does not decide the flow in the latter case.

MOST_SURPRISING = """
While the agent generated responses that I expected in all runs, I found it 
quite surprising that, with such a simple setup, the agent was able to produce 
reasonable response to the out-of-scope request (train schedule). It was aware 
of what it could do and what it could not without explicit instructions baked 
into the system. It even suggested reasonable actions that the user could do 
with the context.
