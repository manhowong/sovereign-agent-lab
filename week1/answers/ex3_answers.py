Exercise 3 — Answers
====================
Fill this in after completing the three Rasa conversations.

CALM vs Old Rasa — what changed
---------------------------------
The old open-source Rasa approach used:
  - nlu.yml: intent training examples
  - rules.yml: explicit dialogue rules
  - FormValidationAction: Python class to parse slot values

Rasa Pro CALM uses:
  - flows.yml: natural language descriptions of what each flow does
  - from_llm slots: the LLM extracts values from conversation
  - ONE custom action: ActionValidateBooking for the business rules

The conversation is the same from the manager's perspective.
The machinery underneath is completely different.

CONVERSATION SCRIPTS
---------------------
Conversation 1 (happy path):
  You:    calling to confirm a booking
  Agent:  [asks guest count]
  You:    160 guests
  Agent:  [asks vegan count]
  You:    about 50 need vegan
  Agent:  [asks deposit]
  You:    £200 deposit
  Agent:  [confirms or escalates?]

Conversation 2 (deposit too high):
  Same as above but use a deposit above £300 (e.g. "£500 deposit").

Conversation 3 (out of scope):
  Start normally, then when asked for vegan count say something like
  "can you arrange parking for the speakers?" and observe what happens.
  Does CALM handle this differently than the old rules approach?

#   nlu.yml intent examples to classify "I'm calling to confirm"
#   rules.yml to define every dialogue path
#
# In Rasa Pro CALM, you need:
#   flow descriptions so the LLM knows when to trigger confirm_booking
#   from_llm slot mappings so the LLM extracts values from natural speech
#   ONE action class (ActionValidateBooking) for the business rules
#
# What does this simplification cost? What does it gain?
# Min 30 words.

CALM_VS_OLD_RASA = """
Cost: You rely on LLM APIs with CALM. You lose the control for the explicit 
rules, which could be useful for some domain-specific application where you 
need absolute deterministic sentence parsing.
LLM calling for info extraction is also slower than rule-based Python code.

Gain: You gain flexibility - LLM understands the context and is able to extract 
ambigous info that doesn't follow standard expression. Development and 
maintenance are also easier without complex logical rules.
"""

# ── The setup cost ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# CALM still required: config.yml, domain.yml, flows.yml, endpoints.yml,
# rasa train, two terminals, and a Rasa Pro licence.
# The old Rasa ALSO needed nlu.yml, rules.yml, and a FormValidationAction.

# CALM is simpler. But it's still significantly more setup than LangGraph.
# That setup bought you something specific.
